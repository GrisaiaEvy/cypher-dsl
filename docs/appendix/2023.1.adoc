== 2023.1

=== 2023.1.0

2023.1.0 is the first feat release after 2023.0.0 and contains several ideas and improvements that stem from https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/sql2cypher[sql2cypher] and from input by @lukaseder. Thank you!

Additionally, we worked again with @ikwattro from https://graphaware.com[Graph Aware] on building the catalog feature. Each statement - regardless of being built or parsed with the Cypher-DSL - can be analyzed via it's catalog now. The catalog will contain labels, types and properties used in a statement and the filters created based on those tokens. You can access the catalog like this:

[source,java]
----
var input = """
    MATCH (m:`Movie` {title: 'The Matrix'})<-[a:`ACTED_IN`]-(p:`Person`)
    WHERE p.born >= $born
    RETURN p
    """;
var statement = CypherParser.parse(input);

var catalog = statement.getCatalog();
----

Also: All AST elements will now render themselves to Cypher-Fragments when used in `toString()` scenarios. Apart from that, all bug fixes and dependency upgrades from 2022.8.5 and 2023.0.4 are included:
