=== 2023.2.0

Thanks to @Andy2003 for his input on the 2023.2.0 release. The main topic of this release is https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/cypher-dsl/issues/596[adding support for semantic comparison]. The Cypher-DSLs builder method creates an AST, so that is in theory an excellent and doable request. The AST has originally been created as good enough means of rendering Cypher proper when we invented the Cypher-DSL for Spring Data Neo4j 6 back in 2019. Good enough here means that it has optimizing potential and a full-blown analysis is - at least at the moment - out of scope.

Instead, we went with another approach: We added ways of normalizing

* Variable names (identifiers for entities (nodes and relationships) and variables of lists and map comprehensions)
* Parameter names
* Aliases

into generated names and optionally make the parsing of literal Cypher maps constant (maps sorted alphabetically and not by order of key appearance).

This allows now for a "poor man's" semantic comparison. Imagine 2 Cypher-DSL `Statement` objects that you either created using the builder or parsed through our parser module. You can compare them like this:

[source,java]
----
static boolean areSemanticallyEquivalent(Statement statement1, Map<String, Object> args1, Statement statement2, Map<String, Object> args2) {

    if (!areSemanticallyEquivalent(statement1, statement2)) {
        return false;
    }

    var mapping1 = statement1.getCatalog().getRenamedParameters();
    var mapping2 = statement2.getCatalog().getRenamedParameters();
    for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : mapping1.entrySet()) {
        String key1 = entry.getKey();
        String mapped = entry.getValue();

        String key2 = mapping2.entrySet().stream().filter(e -> e.getValue().equals(mapped))
            .map(Map.Entry::getKey).findFirst().orElseThrow();
        if (!args1.get(key1).equals(args2.get(key2))) {
            return false;
        }
    }

    return true;
}
----

The catalog featured added in 2023.1.0 has been enhanced so that it can return now the mapping of the renamed parameters as well, allowing for inspection of parameters from different sources.

Also thanks to @hindog for contributing map literals in #642 and to @sathishkumar294 for inspiring the new dedicated overloads for `type` and `labels` that now work with symbolic names, too.
